Disappointed with the usability of the new **Unity interface** in the **Ubuntu Netbook Remix edition** (my screen is not wide enough) I've recently decided to switch my **Linux netbook OS**. My distro of choice was **[MeeGo](http://meego.com/downloads/releases/1.0/meego-v1.0-netbooks)**, but it had some major issues with my **Wi-Fi setup**, so unfortunately I had to let it go. I went for **[Jolicloud](http://www.jolicloud.com)** (project by Netvibes' founder).

### Problem:

My first impressions were rather unpleasant ones. Though the general feel of the launcher is good enough, I couldn't find an **easy way to access the terminal** (apart from a dozen clicks through local/native apps) . And what kind of Linux distribution is this if I can't easily access the command line?

### Solution:

Fortunately, the terminal is conveniently accessible through a not-so-well-documented **keyboard shortcut** that I've stumbled upon reading the **tips & tricks section** in the **[Jolicloud blog](http://www.jolicloud.com/blog/2010/07/20/jolicloud-10-tips-and-tricks/)**. Just **press Alt+F1 to bring up the console**. By the way - the **Menu key** gives access to the **standard Ubuntu menu** (**Jolicloud** is based on **Ubuntu),** which can come in handy too.

### Full listing of the shortcuts (from Jolicloud blog):

*   **Windows key** - main launcher
*   **Alt+Tab** - application switching
*   **Alt+F1** - console access (via classic terminal app)
*   **Alt+F2** - run command (application text launcher)
*   **Alt+F4** - close application
*   **Menu key** - Ubuntu style menu

Using those **keyboard shortcuts** **Jolicloud's usability** is acceptable for daily use (from my perspective). It could use some improvements here and there, but it's much better than **UNR 10.10**. However, the joint venture of **Nokia** (**Maemo**) and **Intel** (**Moblin**) in the form of **MeeGo** looks really promising. So when major bugs are ironed out and more hardware gets supported out of the box it can become one of the most promising **netbook** (mobile) **operating systems** around. Just wait till **[Smeegol](http://news.opensuse.org/2010/10/06/announcing-smeegol-1-0/)** (or **[SUSE MeeGo](http://www.novell.com/news/press/novell-announces-support-for-meego)**) comes preinstalled on new hardware. **Jolicloud** will definitely need to keep up pace.
