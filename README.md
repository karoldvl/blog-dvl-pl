Some long time ago I used to write a bit about my various IT adventures on blog.dvl.pl - it looked like this:

![blog.dvl.pl](screenshot.png "blog.dvl.pl")

Unfortunately, I am unable to maintain this site any longer. Most of the content has become outdated, but I've exported a couple of the most long-lived posts into a static Jekyll site for archival purposes.
